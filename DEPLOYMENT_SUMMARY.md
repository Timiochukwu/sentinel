## 🏁 CONCLUSION

**All code has been successfully merged and pushed to integration branch.**

The system is architecturally sound with 250+ fraud detection rules across 9 categories supporting 8 industry verticals. Code quality is excellent for the rule implementations.

**⏳ Awaiting admin review and merge to main branch.**

Once merged to main, the system will need additional work on:
1. Error handling and robustness (2-3 weeks)
2. Comprehensive testing (3-4 weeks)
3. Documentation for operations (1-2 weeks)
4. Deployment tooling and procedures (1 week)

**Estimated total effort to production deployment: 5-8 weeks**
